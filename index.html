        <h1 style="text-align:left;">An Ideal Insurance Data Analytics Organization - Inspired by little Ants!</h1>
<p>Historically, insurance companies have gained a competitive edge in the life insurance space using a combination of managing risk exposure and underwriting expertise. In the new era of big data analytics, this picture may change. In future, “using creative ways to source data, distinct analytic methods and behavior influencing data – monitoring tools will be game changers in the insurance industry” (Clarke & Libarikian, 2014)7. My ideal organization will be focused on providing insurance solutions based on predictive data analytics. This organization will draw inspiration from one of evolutions most successful natural teams; Ants.

Ant teams have been successful in very challenging situations and their origin goes back to millions of years. My ideal organization, named “Formicidae” (scientific name for “Ant”) will analyze big data from lots of varied sources and provide reliable insurance solutions consistently by making the best decisions based on evidence available, market information and ethics. With time, Formicidae will need to scale up in order to meet the demands of more and more insurance companies with the same quality and reliability of service.
<br /><br />
<b>Survival in the Messy marketplace</b>
<br /><br />
In this world of constantly changing regulations and customer demand, Formicidae will use the “Pen, Price tag and Flashlight” approach to deal with the changing market place18. With every changing regulation, a Formicidae leader will pick up a pen and write a rule, attach a price tag and make it visible. In order to do this, we need to be working closely with the sales agents and government organizations to get the latest information on regulatory changes and understand its impact on the market.

Ants make decisions based on local information, which they communicate throughout their colony quickly using chemical and tactile signals8. We cannot use chemical signals, yet with the advent of Big Data and social networking, it is possible for sales people who are closest to the marketplace to gather and analyze information - and then quickly communicate (flashlight) to their team members without circling back through headquarters. By adapting this way, Formicidae can be quick, nimble, reliable and consistent while reacting to changes in the marketplace.

<br /><br />
<b>Organization Structure</b>
<br /><br />
In an ant colony, there are different team roles - workers, nurses, soldiers and queen ants11. The ants play their roles and sometimes play each other’s roles based on the needs of their colony. The ant colony performs a variety of complex tasks very efficiently due to their ability to self-manage and willingness to share responsibilities. Inspired by the ant’s flexibility in assuming different team roles, teams in Formicidae will work in small tightly coupled groups of no more than 5 talented individuals and will be encouraged to serve as backups of each other. If a 5 member team seems overburdened, the work function may be broken down or the work may be redistributed.

Inspired by the Ant world and using the principle that the “best management is no management at all”, Formicidae will have a pretty flat architecture with minimal hierarchy. These tightly coupled teams will bring experience in different areas and skills. For e.g. one team member will own the area of keeping track of government regulations and changes to the insurance world, another will own the sales relationships throughout the country and monitor the marketplace, third will look at new sources of data and how we can make sense of it, fourth member will forecast information based on available data and create predictive data models. There will be a project manager for every team to co-ordinate the work, manage deadlines and communicate with stakeholders. Every team will be designated to 2 or 3 insurance companies as customers. This organization will have an IT team to manage and support the software systems, which source and analyze data in order to build predictive models. In addition, there will be an HR and a legal team.
<br /><br />
<b>Leadership and organizational culture</b>
<br /><br />
“The lone inventor is a myth”- IDEO has used this concept to remain successful for years and so have the ants13. Ant’s collective intelligence or swarm theory16, as described by National Geographic, is critical for their survival9. By engaging everyone, trusting each other and learning from their group’s collective mistakes, Formicidae will be able to learn and grow faster.

Leaders of the organization will be responsible for seeing the big picture, communicating organizational goals in a “sesame street simple way”, energizing the team towards common goals, celebrating “small wins” along the way and serving as a “human shield” when their teams need them2. Formicidae is similar to Netflix and IDEO in a way because they all need to constantly innovate and develop new creative solutions in short cycles to survive in the marketplace. Following Netflix’s approach, Formicidae will not have room for micromanagers. Leaders will need to understand and implement Lasorda’s law and learn how to be just assertive enough to get the work done.

Evidence shows that “Bad is stronger than good” and “bad apples” can bring down performance by 30 to 40% as compared to teams to don’t have them. In order to enforce and keep this rule alive, leaders at Formicidae will be responsible for making this rule public. Considering the evidence that shows how “bad apples” spread negative feelings and demotivate other employees, leaders at Formicidae will need to identify and if necessary remove assholes in order to keep the organization productive6.

<b>Motivation, reward structure</b>
<br /><br />
<b>Altruism</b>
<br /><br />
One biological trait of ants is Altruism – “a self-denying behavior performed for the benefit of others”14. The worker ants work for the benefit of the fertile reproductive queen. They give up their own reproductive ability to look after the queen’s descendants. The soldier ants take upon the responsibility of facing danger to defend the colony and leaving their nest to search for food. This kind of “extreme accountability” can also be seen in employees during the “attack on Taj” (Sutton & Rao, 2014)3. At Formicidae, employees will be rewarded for Altruism. Leaders will trust their employees’ commitment towards their organization and give employees a few hours or days of freedom to work on activities of their own choice. As per Cialdini’s reciprocation principle, employees will appreciate this trust and will be “obligated to return the favor” by performing even better (Cialdini, 2007)1.
<br /><br />
<b>Pygmalion Effect</b>
<br /><br />
Since the work here involves a lot of cognitive abilities, leaders will inspire their teams by using the Pygmalion Effect. By expressing the high level of confidence they have in their teams, leaders should be able to bring about greater performance from team members13. Since, innovation needs the ability to believe in nonsense sometimes, it is important for the team to believe in each other and in themselves.
<br /><br />
<b>Self-Organizing Ant Networks</b>
<br /><br />
When part of an ant structure is destroyed, ants tend to self-organize and assume different roles to rebuild the lost structure and meet the group’s goals most effectively. Similarly, in telecommunication networks, self-organizing network (SON) is used to monitor performance and self-organize on encountering an issue to provide the optimum performance15. In order to motivate similar behavior, employees will be rewarded with a Formicidae certificate of honor for taking responsibility of another member’s work in their absence. Considering the evidence showing the damaging role of financial incentives in organizations, Formicidae will refrain from financial incentives as much as possible4.
<br /><br />
<b>Open source platform</b>
<br /><br />
Formicidae will use an open platform to source creative solutions from public19. Dan Pink’s article and other evidence show that “people like being a part of a community in which they compete with the best people in the field” and contribute towards greater good (Labarre & Taylor, 2008)5.

Leaders in Formicidae will need to constantly monitor and understand what motivates the employees and if employees have work that is intrinsically interesting, exciting and motivating to them. Depending on what truly motivates the employees, leaders will continuously re-design and make improvements to the reward structure which may use a combination of financial incentives, providing more freedom or honoring employees. The reward structure will be designed to promote team work, proactive behavior, accountability and creative thinking.
<br /><br />
Hiring the best using The No Asshole Rule
<br /><br />
While hiring at Formicidae, interviewers will look for not only the best talent but also candidates who have the right attitudes and feel accountable for what they do. They will keep the “no asshole rule” in mind and screen out “bad apples” (Sutton, 2007)6. Evidence shows that assholes hire other assholes and make their population grow. Screening them out during the hiring process will prevent the “asshole taxes” and save the company from losses.

In addition, using Schmidt and Hunter’s combination method of “GMA plus a structured interview”, Formicidae will be able to get an insight into the candidate’s abilities as this method is a powerful predictor of job performance13. “Reference checks” will be used to screen honest and trust worthy candidates. Wherever possible, “job sample tests” on real life problems will help in setting realistic expectations.

<b>Building a culture of Innovation</>
<br /><br />
<b>Felt Empathy</b>
<br /><br />
In insurance, a large part of the credibility of a company is determined by the ethical choices the company makes while paying out claims. Ethically correct behavior needs to be rewarded. Since Formicidae will only be involved in providing predictive analytics solutions to clients, we may not have a direct role in making ethical choices. However, we can do our part by providing ethical recommendations to insurance firms. In order to motivate this behavior, Formicidae will build a culture of “felt empathy” in the organization17. By creating opportunities for employees to meet victims of “bad faith insurance” companies, employees will be able to relate to the customer’s pain and empathize with them. This in turn will drive them to provide ethically correct recommendations to insurance companies.

Using Perry Klebahn’s approach to innovation and organizational change, Formicidae will use the process of empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping and testing20. This process of constantly remaining in touch with the needs of the customer, getting early feedback, implementing prototypes and testing solutions out with customers will help Formicidae drive a continuous cycle of sustainable innovation.

Since the team needs to be creative in finding new data sources and ways of analyzing and predicting information, the leader will need to be adept in keeping the team focused yet engaged in constructive conflict (like Brad Bird from Pixar).
<br /><br />
<b>Scaling up excellence</b>
<br /><br />
As part of a research, the ant colony’s access to food was removed11. It was noted that instead of wasting time or being idle, the food-hunting ants were self-motivated to quickly switch to another task – taking care of the young! This is a great example of how the little ants are motivated to assume responsibility as if they “own the place”. Perry Klebahn’s experience with United and numerous other stories indicate the need to build accountability in organizations12. While scaling up, it is important for Formicidae to keep this in mind and hire people who “feel compelled to act in the organization’s best interests” (Sutton & Rao, 2014)3.

Once we have attracted the right people, Formicidae will implement Cialdini’s principal of social proof to influence more and more employees with this behavior. As employees look around for “social evidence”, they will find others reflecting accountability and providing excellent customer service, which in turn will influence them to “decide what constitutes correct behavior”1.

Last but not the least; Formicidae will try to “create a common heartbeat” (Sutton & Rao, 2014) in order to get team members to understand top priorities, stay synchronized with each other and know how they can get the best out of each other3. “The daily scrum” will be a great way to keep the team fast paced and ready to adapt to the constantly changing marketplace and demands of insurance firms.

<b>Conclusion</b>
<br /><br />
In summary, Formicidae will be built on the foundations of empathy, trust, accountability and inspired by the team spirit of little ants10! This ideal organization will value “doing the right thing” and be a place where people are motivated to innovate and learn every day to provide the right and ethically correct insurance solutions.
